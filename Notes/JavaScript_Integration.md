# JavaScript Integration Notes

This document summarizes research and implementation notes on JavaScript technologies used in Bridge.

## JavaScript Engines

Bridge research explored various JavaScript engines:

### V8 (Google)

V8 is Google's high-performance JavaScript engine:

- Powers Chrome and Node.js
- Offers high performance with JIT compilation
- Complex to integrate directly due to C++ API
- Frequent API changes between versions

Key files:
- [V8.txt](V8.txt) - Integration approaches and optimization techniques

### ChakraCore (Microsoft)

Microsoft's JavaScript engine:

- Previously used in Edge (before Chromium adoption)
- Open source with .NET integration options
- Integration with Unity explored

Key files:
- [Microsoft-Chakra.txt](Microsoft-Chakra.txt) - Integration notes

## JSON Technologies

Bridge makes extensive use of JSON for data exchange:

- JSON.NET integration for high-performance JSON parsing in C#
- Custom converters for Unity types (Vector3, Color, etc.)
- Techniques for efficient JSON handling

Key files:
- [JSON.net.txt](JSON.net.txt) - JSON.NET usage notes
- [UnityJSON.txt](UnityJSON.txt) - Unity-specific JSON handling
- [fullserializer-to-jsondotnet.txt](fullserializer-to-jsondotnet.txt) - Migration guidelines

## Communication Libraries

Bridge leverages communication libraries for networking:

### Socket.IO

Socket.IO provides real-time bidirectional event-based communication:

- Used for communication between Unity and external JavaScript environments
- Supports reconnection and fallback mechanisms
- Works across platforms including WebGL

Key files:
- [SocketIO.txt](SocketIO.txt) - Socket.IO integration notes

## TypeScript

Bridge supports TypeScript for type-safe JavaScript development:

- TypeScript compilation targets modern JavaScript standards
- Provides IDE integration and better tooling
- Type definitions for Bridge API

Key files:
- [typescript.txt](typescript.txt) - TypeScript integration guidelines

## JavaScript Development Workflows

Bridge implements developer-friendly workflows:

- Live reloading of JavaScript code without Unity recompilation
- Source maps for debugging
- Integration with JavaScript bundlers and build tools

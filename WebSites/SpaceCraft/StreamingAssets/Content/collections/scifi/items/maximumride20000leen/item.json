  "description": "Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment launches James Patterson's bestselling series about genetically engineered children with wings who can fly. Fourteen-year-old Maximum \"Max\" Ride leads the \"Flock\"—a group of six kids including Fang, Iggy, Nudge, Gasman, and six-year-old Angel—who escaped from \"The School,\" a sinister laboratory where they were subjected to genetic experiments. When Angel is kidnapped and taken back to the facility, Max and her friends must brave a dangerous rescue mission that takes them from the California desert to New York City. They face off against \"Erasers,\" terrifying half-human, half-wolf creatures created to hunt them down. As Max discovers that her purpose may be to save the world, the series combines fast-paced action with themes of family, survival, and what it means to be human. This young adult science fiction thriller series blends genetic engineering, superhuman abilities, and high-stakes adventure.",

  "description": "Susan Beth Pfeffer's \"Life as We Knew It\" presents a gripping young adult disaster scenario through the diary entries of sixteen-year-old Miranda, whose world is forever changed when an asteroid impact knocks the moon closer to Earth. This seemingly minor astronomical event triggers a cascade of global catastrophes including massive tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and dramatic climate shifts that quickly bring modern civilization to its knees. As supply chains collapse and basic services fail, Miranda and her family must adapt to a new reality where survival depends on hoarding food, maintaining warmth, and preserving hope in the face of an increasingly desperate situation.\n\nThe novel's power lies in its intimate focus on one family's experience during a global catastrophe, examining how ordinary people cope when the fundamental assumptions of modern life are stripped away. Pfeffer doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of resource scarcity, social breakdown, and the difficult moral choices that survival sometimes requires. The diary format creates an immediate, personal connection with Miranda's experience while documenting the gradual erosion of normalcy and the psychological toll of living in constant uncertainty. The book effectively captures the vulnerability of modern technological society and serves as both compelling young adult fiction and thoughtful examination of how individuals and families might respond to civilizational collapse.",

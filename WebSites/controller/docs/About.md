# SpaceCraft Controller

**🏠 About** - App information and getting started

**🧭 Navigate** - Move your view around the 3D space, pan and zoom to explore collections

**👆 Select** - Point and choose items, select multiple things, toggle selections on/off

**🔍 Inspect** - Look inside items in detail, view web pages and documents embedded in the simulator

**🌍 Gravity** - Search for items and make matching ones attract or repel with physics forces - type "science" and crank up gravity to pull all science books toward the center, or reverse it to scatter them away

**🧲 Magnet** - Create magnetic hotspots that pull items around - drop a "fiction" magnet and watch novels fly toward it, use device tilt to move magnets around in real-time

**⚙️ Adjust** - Fine-tune physics settings, friction, forces, and visual parameters to get the simulation feeling just right

Each tab gives you different powers over the physics simulation - from gently browsing to dramatically reshaping how thousands of items behave based on their content and your interests.

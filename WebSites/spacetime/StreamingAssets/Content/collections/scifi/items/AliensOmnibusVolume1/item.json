  "description": "Dark Horse Comics took the industry by storm with its release of  Aliens , a comics series that for the first time captured the power of film source material and expanded its universe in a way that fans applauded worldwide. Now, the first three Dark Horse  Aliens series- Outbreak ,  Nightmare Asylum , and  Female War -are collected in a value-priced, quality-format omnibus, featuring nearly four hundred story pages in full color. Written by screen and television scribe Mark Verheiden ( The Mask, Battlestar Gallactica)  and illustrated with consummate skill by Mark A. Nelson, Den Beauvais, and Sam Kieth,  Aliens Omnibus  Vol. 1 is an essential piece of the  Aliens  mythos and a great entry point into the storied Dark Horse  Aliens  library.",

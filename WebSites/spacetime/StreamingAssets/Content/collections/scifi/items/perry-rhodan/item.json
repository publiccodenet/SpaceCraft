Designated as <i>Space Fiction</i> rather than Science Fiction, it tells of Man's rise under the leadership of ex-astronaut Perry Rhodan to a position as the supreme power in the Galaxy.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Each volume presents the contents of one complete issue from the original magazines.</div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<div>Due to its origins as a pulp magazine serial, each story is of magazine-length: what we would usually think of as <i>novella</i> length: rather than being of full novel-length. However, given that this is a continuing serial of virtually <i>infinite</i> length, with hundreds of issues already published in English, and thouands published in German, that does not seem any real drawback!</div>\n\n<div><br /></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n\n<div>\n<p style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:1.2em;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;margin:0pt 0pt 2pt;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-style:italic;\">Perry Rhodan, the American commander of the first manned Moon–mission, returns to Earth, landing in the Gobi Desert where he establishes a base with the aid of the super–technology in the Arkonide research vessel he discovered on the Moon</span>.<br /><br /></p>\n<p style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:1.2em;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;margin:0pt 0pt 2pt;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-style:italic;\">Beneath an impenetrable energy shield—which defies all attacks by the terrestrial Superpowers–he is invulnerable.

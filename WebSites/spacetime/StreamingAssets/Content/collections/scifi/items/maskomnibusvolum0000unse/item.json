    "It has all the makings of an epic adventure: an ancient artifact is rediscovered, a mask of unknown origins, with unforeseen power and magic. But who knew that after donning this mask even the wimpiest geek would become an indestructible, shape-changing supertornado with a mind for mischief and an appetite for destruction? Equally adept with gun, knife, bat, bomb, pie, or bat-knife-gun-pie-bomb, geek-turned-superfreak the Mask cuts a crazed swath of cartoon mayhem! This original comic trilogy inspired the hit film The Mask, which has grossed over $450 million worldwide since its release in 1994",

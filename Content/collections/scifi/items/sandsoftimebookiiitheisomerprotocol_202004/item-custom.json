  "spacecraft_description": "Sands of Time Book III: The Isomer Protocol continues this science fiction series that appears to blend temporal mechanics with hard science concepts. The title suggests a focus on chemistry and molecular structures, as isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms. This scientific foundation likely extends to the story's exploration of time travel, parallel realities, or alternate timelines, where small changes in structure can lead to dramatically different outcomes. The protocol aspect implies systematic approaches to dealing with temporal or dimensional phenomena, suggesting a more organized and scientific approach to time-related concepts than typical time travel fiction. The series appears to build upon previous volumes, developing a complex mythology around time manipulation and its consequences for individuals and civilizations.",

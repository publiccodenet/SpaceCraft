  "description": "Fake 'Ancient' Chinese history as a propaganda vehicle for China! Following in the steps of Issac Newton and NASA research of earth-moon mechanics by late astrophysicist Robert Newton the mathematicians of Moscow University Dr Fomenko and Dr Nosovsky had a close look at allegedly ancient and irrefutable China and found no less:The history of China up until the XV century A.D. is, in fact, a copy of allegedÂ  histories of Rome and Byzantium. Historical chronicles were transplanted to China by the Jesuits in the XVI-XVII century A.D. Mathematicians Dr Fomenko and Dr Nosovsky refute that:a) China is exceptionally ancient;b) China has invented silk, paper, powder, printing, logarithms, astronomy; The corollaries related in the present book are:a new interpretation of Western European historya new interpretation of Chinese history ;a new interpretation of Egyptian historya solution of the identity of the EtruscansFacts are stubborn things!https://evilempire.blog/history-fiction-or-science-chronology-vol-5/https://evilempire.blog/",

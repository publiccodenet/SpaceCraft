  "spacecraft_description": "Sands of Time by Sean David Morton is the foundational volume of a science fiction series that explores temporal mechanics and the scientific possibilities of time travel. Morton brings a background in both science and speculative research to his fiction, creating narratives that blend real scientific theories with imaginative exploration of time-related phenomena. This inaugural volume likely establishes the scientific framework and character foundations for the series, introducing concepts of temporal manipulation, the nature of time itself, and the potential consequences of altering past or future events. The title evokes both the measurement of time through hourglasses and the vast scales of geological and cosmic time, suggesting a story that operates across multiple temporal scales and examines humanity's relationship with time as both a fundamental force and a potential tool.",

  "description": "In the darkness of Jupiter, terror is unleashed because humans have trespassed on Europa. Wayne Faust and Charles Eugene Anderson's Dark Curtain Saga is rich, a multi-layered space-opera horror story that will scare you. Europa Ghost Story is a small and terrifying tale taking place during man's first ventures to Europa. A space-spectre stalks our solar system and waits patiently for someone to take evil back to Earth.  Will you take the nightmare home? Nebula Award-winning author Edward Bryant called Europa Nightmare, ‘a rich bouillabaisse of characters and story.’",

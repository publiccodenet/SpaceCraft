  "description": "This is all 12 issues of Astounding Stories from 1931. January through August were published without a copyright notice. I've done a US copyright renewal search for September through December and have found no renewals affecting those issues. A renewal search is not conclusive and I'm neither a lawyer or a librarian. Do your own search.",

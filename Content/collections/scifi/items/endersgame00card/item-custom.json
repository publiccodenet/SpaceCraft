  "spacecraft_description": "Ender's Game is a military science fiction novel that follows Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin, a brilliant six-year-old boy recruited by the International Fleet to attend Battle School, an orbital training facility. In this coming-of-age story, children are trained in zero-gravity combat rooms to fight against an alien species known as \"buggers\" or \"formics,\" insect-like creatures who previously invaded Earth. Ender excels at tactical simulations and leadership, unaware that his final \"simulation\" is actually commanding the real fleet in a decisive battle that destroys the bugger homeworld. The novel explores themes of childhood innocence lost to warfare, the ethics of xenocide, and the psychological cost of being molded into the perfect military commander. Card's work examines how society exploits gifted children and the moral complexity of survival against an alien threat.",

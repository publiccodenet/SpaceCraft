  "description": "Very early on, from 1978 onward, real-world space exploration related articles were included in Starlog as background articles for illustrative purposes. This gave O'Quinn and Jacobs the idea to launch a true and similar sister magazine Future Life that broached the subject from the opposite site of the spectrum; real world space exploration articles, lightened up with articles stemming from the realm of science fiction film, television and literature. The magazine, featuring interviews with real world scientists such as Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clark, launched in April 1978 as a (bi-)monthly publication. The publication did not enjoy as near a success as its sister publication had, and publication ceased after 31 issues in December 1981.",

    "Your Guide to the 21st Century!  It starts with  Software , where rebel robots bring immortality to their human creator by eating his brain. Software won the first Philip K. Dick Award.  In  Wetware , the robots decide to start building people—and people get strung out on an insane new drug called merge. This cyberpunk classic garnered a second Philip K. Dick award.  By  Freeware , the robots have evolved into soft plastic slugs called moldies­—and some human “cheeseballs” want to have sex with them. The action redoubles when aliens begin arriving in the form of cosmic rays.  And with  Realware , the humans and robots find a wormhole with god inside, learn the art of direct matter control, get wacked out as usual—and find true love.

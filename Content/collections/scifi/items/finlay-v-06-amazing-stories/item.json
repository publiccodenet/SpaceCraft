  "description": "A nearly complete collection of the commercial black and white SF and Fantasy art of Virgil Finlay, over 1800 illustrations. Finlay was America's most acclaimed science fiction illustrator, appearing in pulps and digests from 1935 until 1969. He perfected a painstaking, nearly photo-realistic technique using scratchboard and stipple work. His work has never been excelled in this department.",

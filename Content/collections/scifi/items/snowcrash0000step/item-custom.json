  "spacecraft_description": "Snow Crash is Neal Stephenson's groundbreaking cyberpunk novel set in a dystopian near-future America where the federal government has collapsed and territory is controlled by corporate franchises, including the Mafia. Hiro Protagonist is a hacker and pizza delivery driver who navigates both the physical world and the Metaverse, a virtual reality successor to the internet where people interact through avatars. When a mysterious virus called Snow Crash begins affecting both computer systems and human brains, Hiro teams up with teenage courier Y.T. to investigate the conspiracy. The virus is connected to ancient Sumerian language and mythology, controlled by media mogul L. Bob Rife who seeks to use it for mind control. The novel explores themes of language as a virus, the power of information, corporate dominance, and the intersection of ancient mythology with cutting-edge technology. Stephenson's prescient vision of virtual worlds, avatars, and networked society has influenced everything from the modern internet to virtual reality development.",

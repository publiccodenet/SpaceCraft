  "description": "The concept of the facsimile reprint may have been invented by Charles Bragin back in the 1940s with his Dime Novel Club which published facsimile editions of dime novels (from 1945-1960). One of the first companies to attempt to extend the practice to pulp magazines was Odyssey Publications. From 1974 to 1981, Odyssey Publications published a series of eleven anthologies of pulp stories in a perfect-bound trade paperback format. The original plan was to publish sets of four titles: two \"full count\" reprints of single issues of pulps and two original \"best of\" collections of stories selected by a group of editors. Each volume would feature stories from a particular pulp title. Though they were called \"full count\" reprints, the Odyssey Publications reprints of single issues of pulps were not complete cover-to-cover facsimiles because they omitted all the original ads and thus had fewer pages and different pagination. By the time the company finally went out of business sometime around 1986, only six \"full count\" reprints and five original collections had been published.    Note: If the covers of some issues appear off-register, it's not the scan. The color registration of covers of the Odyssey Publications was often badly off register. The contents lists for this single issue reprint comes from the FictionMags index at philsp.com and refers to the original pulp issue, not this Odyssey reprint. Because the advertising matter was deleted from the reprint, the pagination differs.

  "spacecraft_description": "Tim Lebbon's \"Into the Void\" serves as a standalone novel set in the Dawn of the Jedi era of the Star Wars expanded universe, taking place approximately 25,000 years before the original trilogy. The story explores the ancient origins of the Jedi Order on the remote world of Tython, where the earliest Force-users, known as Je'daii, are still learning to understand and balance the mystical energy field that connects all living things. Unlike the later Jedi, these ancient practitioners seek harmony between the light and dark aspects of the Force, believing that balance rather than the supremacy of light is the key to wisdom and power.\n\nThe novel follows the Je'daii as they face the dangerous challenges of colonizing Tython, a world where the Force itself is unusually strong and potentially unstable. When the delicate balance is threatened, some Je'daii risk falling to the dark side while others struggle to maintain the philosophical equilibrium that their order was founded upon. Lebbon explores themes of balance, temptation, and the early development of Force philosophy, providing background for concepts that would later evolve into the rigid light-versus-dark paradigm of the later Jedi and Sith orders. The book includes connections to the Dark Horse Comics series of the same name and features an original short story by John Ostrander, making it both a standalone work and part of the larger Dawn of the Jedi multimedia project that examines the earliest days of Force-users in the Star Wars galaxy.",

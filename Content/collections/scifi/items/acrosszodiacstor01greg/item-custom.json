  "spacecraft_description": "Published in 1880, Across the Zodiac stands as one of the earliest examples of hard science fiction, pioneering many concepts that would become staples of the genre. The novel tells the story of an unnamed narrator who discovers a manuscript detailing a voyage to Mars using a spacecraft powered by 'apergy,' a fictional anti-gravity force. The traveler reaches Mars and discovers an advanced civilization with technology far beyond Earth's, including electric vehicles, advanced medicine, and sophisticated communication systems.\n\nGreg's Martian society is a complex dystopia that serves as a vehicle for social and political commentary. The Martians live under a highly regulated socialist system where the state controls reproduction, education, and most aspects of daily life. Women have achieved legal equality but at the cost of romance and emotional connection, leading to a cold, utilitarian society. The protagonist becomes involved with a Martian woman named Eveena, and their relationship provides a contrast between Earth's emotional bonds and Mars's sterile social arrangements.\n\nThe novel is significant for its detailed scientific speculation and world-building, introducing concepts like airlocks, spacesuits, and the challenges of interplanetary travel decades before they became scientific realities. Greg's work influenced later science fiction writers and established many conventions of the planetary romance subgenre. Despite its Victorian-era perspective and sometimes dated social views, Across the Zodiac remains important as an early attempt to combine rigorous scientific speculation with social criticism and adventure narrative.",

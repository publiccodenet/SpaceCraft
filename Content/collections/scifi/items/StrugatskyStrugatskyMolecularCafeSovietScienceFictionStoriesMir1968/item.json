  "description": " The book contains stories pub­lished by Soviet science-fiction wri­ters in the last three or tour years. Ot course, neither the selection of the authors in this little book, nor the stories themselves can offer a com­prehensive idea ot Soviet Science fiction, which is so diverse and multiform. At present, more than a hundred Soviet writers are working in the field. Several large story col­lections, novels and serial books are published each year. Science, philos­ophy, sociology, humour, satire are some ot their topics. We hope that this book will ap­peal to the foreign reader and will promote understanding between our nations. The book was published by Mir in 1968.

  "spacecraft_description": "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is Philip K. Dick's seminal cyberpunk novel that explores the nature of humanity and empathy in a post-apocalyptic world. Set in 2021 after World War Terminus, bounty hunter Rick Deckard hunts escaped androids (replicants) from Mars colonies who have illegally returned to Earth. In a world devastated by radioactive fallout, owning real animals has become a status symbol and moral imperative, while most people settle for electric animals. Deckard uses the Voigt-Kampff test to detect androids by measuring their empathetic responses, as androids supposedly lack true empathy. The story follows Deckard's moral crisis as he begins to question the ethics of his work and develops empathy for the androids he's hunting. The novel explores themes of what defines humanity, the importance of empathy, artificial intelligence, and environmental destruction, while critiquing consumer culture and questioning the boundaries between authentic and artificial life.",

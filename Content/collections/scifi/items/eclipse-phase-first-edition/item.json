  "description": "This is an archive of almost all of the first edition of Eclipse Phase , a tabletop RPG which is described both as \"The Roleplaying Game of Transhuman Conspiracy and Horror\" and as \"a sci-fi RPG where you play as transhuman agents exploring the solar system and beyond.\"  Eclipse Phase is currently on its second edition and materials from the first edition are becoming harder to come by.  More importantly, much of the fan made material for the first edition has been lost to time as it was only ever posted on blogs or forums which no longer exist at all.  But archive.org didn't even have the core rulebooks for the first edition saved before this upload, so I may as well upload the entire first edition, both official and unofficial.",

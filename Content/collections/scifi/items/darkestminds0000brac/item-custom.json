  "spacecraft_description": "The Darkest Minds is a dystopian young adult novel set in a near-future America where a mysterious disease called IAAN (Idiopathic Adolescent Acute Neurodegeneration) has killed most children, leaving survivors with dangerous psychic abilities. These children, classified by color-coded power levels, are imprisoned in government rehabilitation camps. Sixteen-year-old Ruby has hidden her true Orange-level abilities (mind control and memory manipulation) by convincing officials she's a harmless Green. When she escapes the brutal Thurmond camp with the help of the Children's League, Ruby joins a group of fellow runaways: Liam, their charismatic leader; Chubs, his sarcastic best friend; and Zu, a traumatized Yellow who no longer speaks. Together they search for East River, a rumored safe haven for kids like them. The novel explores themes of survival, friendship, and the consequences of fear-driven oppression as Ruby struggles with her dangerous powers and the painful memory of accidentally erasing herself from her parents' minds.",

  "spacecraft_description": "Cassandra Clare's \"City of Bones\" is the first novel in The Mortal Instruments series, an urban fantasy saga that follows fifteen-year-old Clary Fray as she discovers a hidden world of Shadowhuntersâ€”warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. Set in contemporary New York City, the story blends modern urban settings with ancient mythologies, featuring angels, demons, faeries, and other supernatural beings. When Clary witnesses a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and wielding bizarre weapons, she enters a world of half-angel warriors and discovers she possesses the Sight, allowing her to see beyond the mundane world. Note: This urban fantasy work appears to be miscategorized in this science fiction collection, as it focuses on supernatural and magical elements rather than scientific or technological themes.",

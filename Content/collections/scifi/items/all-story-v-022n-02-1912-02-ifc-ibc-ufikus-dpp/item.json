  "description": "Here's a scan of one of the world's rarest pulp magazines, the February 1912 issue of The All-Story magazine (a copy sold at auction on June 9, 2022 for $36,000). This was the issue that launched the literary career of Edgar Rice Burroughs. It contains the first five chapters of the six-part serialization of \"Under The Moons Of Mars,\" the first adventure of John Carter of Mars. For the serial publication, Burroughs had chosen to use the pseudonym of \" Normal Bean \" as a type of pun stressing that he was in his right mind, being concerned he might suffer ridicule for writing such a fantastic story. The effect was spoiled when a typesetter changed \"Normal\" to \"Norman\" on the assumption that the former was a typographical error. Numerous changes were also made to the novel by editorial hands at the magazine. In 1917, under the title A Princess Of Mars , the novel was released in book form by A. C. McClurg, restored to Burroughs' original version, and this is the version that has remained in print since that time. Note: The scan is missing the inside front cover and the inside back cover.

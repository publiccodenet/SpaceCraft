  "spacecraft_description": "Renegades by Marissa Meyer is a young adult superhero science fiction novel set in a world where individuals with supernatural abilities, known as prodigies, exist alongside ordinary humans. The story takes place in a society recovering from the Age of Anarchy, when villains ruled and heroes, called the Renegades, rose up to restore order and justice. The narrative follows Nova, who has lived her entire life seeking revenge against the Renegades for failing to save her family, and Adrian, a Renegade with the power to bring his drawings to life. As Nova infiltrates the Renegades organization while hiding her own villainous identity, the story explores themes of justice, revenge, power, and the gray areas between good and evil. Meyer creates a complex world where the line between hero and villain is often blurred, examining questions about authority, vigilantism, and what it truly means to be a hero.",

  "description": "All 21 novelizations written by James Luceno and Brian Daley (under the pseudonym \"Jack McKinney\") covering the entire Robotech saga. From Wikipedia:  Books #1–12 novelize the story of the TV series; Books #1–6 cover the story of The Macross Saga (at the time known simply as the \"First Generation\"); The Masters (the \"Second Generation\") is covered in Books #7–9; and finally, New Generation (\"Third Generation\") is adapted in Books #10–12. Books #13–17 document the story of the aborted sequel TV series, The Sentinels. Book #18 is unique as it is set after the events of the final episode of Robotech and wraps up all of the outstanding plotlines and questions that remained after the series ended. Published in 1989, this book was considered to be the final chapter of the Robotech series until the 2006 release of Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles, which introduced a radically alternate storyline. The last three books were published from 1994–1996. Collectively labelled the \"Lost Generation\", they take place in the assorted \"gaps\" in the timeline; Book #19 takes place between the end of the First Generation and the start of The Sentinels, incorporating an adaptation of the Eternity Comic series The Malcontent Uprisings; Book #20 is set following the beginning of The Sentinels but before the start of the Second Generation, incorporating elements from the plots of Robotech: The Movie and Eternity Comics' CyberPirates; and the final book, #21, occurs during the period between the Second and Third Generations and details the Invid invasion of Earth.",

  "description": "Empire Classics Presents Alien: The Complete History.  This Special Collectors' Edition magazine  charts the gestation of Ridley Scott’s horror classic and the genesis of its most shocking moment, as well as the making of James Cameron’s tooled-up sequel and a look at why it’s the perfect follow-up. Then it’s onto the troubled production of  Alien 3 , with original set reports and a journey into Vincent Ward’s left-field vision to set the third film on a wooden planet populated by monks. Completing the original cycle, there’s the making of  Alien: Resurrection  as well as interviews with Jeunet and Sigourney Weaver herself. But the story of  Alien  didn’t end in 1997 – the series continued in the ‘00s with the controversial  Alien vs. Predator  entries, before Ridley Scott returned to repopulate the universe he originally spawned with  Prometheus  and  Alien: Covenant . Inside the mag, just waiting to burst out, you’ll find set reports, interviews, reviews, and much, much more from all of those movies.",

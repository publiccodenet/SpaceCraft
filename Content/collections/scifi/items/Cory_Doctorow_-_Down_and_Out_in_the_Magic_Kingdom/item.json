    "From craphound.com: My first novel was published in January 2003. It concerns the machinations of technologically immportals who have occupied Walt Disney World's Haunted Mansion and who aim to preserve it from the depredations of modernizers who would renovate it. The book won the 2003 Locus Award for Best First Novel and is a finalist for the 2004 Nebula for Best Novel.",

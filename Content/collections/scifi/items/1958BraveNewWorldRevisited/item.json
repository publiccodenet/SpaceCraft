  "description": "Brave New World Revisited When the novel Brave New World first appeared in 1932, its shocking analysis of a scientific dictatorship seemed a projection into the remote future. Here, in one of the most important and fascinating books of his career, Aldous Huxley uses his tremendous knowledge of human relations to compare the modern-day world with his prophetic fantasy. He scrutinizes threats to humanity, such as overpopulation, propaganda, and chemical persuasion, and explains why we have found it virtually impossible to avoid them. Brave New World Revisited is a trenchant plea that humankind should educate itself for freedom before it is too late. This is a modified version of the original upload at https://archive.org/details/BraveNewWorld-and-BraveNewWorldRevisited with the following changes: The front & back covers have had colour-corrected. The inner-pages of the book have been converted to black & white for improved readabilty. Blank pages have been removed. Each page has been de-skewed (straightened) in software. The text on each page has been recognised with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software. See \"Brave New World\" also:Â  https://archive.org/details/1932BraveNewWorld",

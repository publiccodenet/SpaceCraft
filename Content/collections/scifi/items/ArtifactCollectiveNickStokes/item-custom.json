  "spacecraft_description": "Artifact Collective: an attempt to consciousness represents a unique experimental literary work that pushes the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction, between individual and collective experience. Author Nick Stokes has created what he describes as 'an attempt to create consciousness in a book' - a metafictional exploration that begins with the reader trapped in darkness under great weight, unable to move. The work employs multiple perspectives and pronouns (his, her, their, our, your, my) to explore the nature of consciousness and identity through speculative scenarios about the reader's condition.\n\nThe book functions as both a corpus and an artifact, incorporating historical, scientific, and found materials alongside original content. It explores complex themes including quantum theory, cosmology, possible futures, intellectual property, interwoven presents, the commons, and the relationship between individual and collective mind. Published under a Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 License, the work embodies the collaborative and open-source principles it discusses. Stokes has created a challenging piece of contemporary literature that sits at the intersection of experimental fiction, philosophy, and consciousness studies, questioning the very nature of what it means to exist and be aware.",

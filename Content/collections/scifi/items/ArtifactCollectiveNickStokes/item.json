  "description": "<div>ARTIFACT COLLECTIVE is an attempt to create consciousness in a book. You\n begin. You are trapped in the dark under a great weight. You cannot \nmove. His, her, their, our, your, and my consciousnesses take shape \nthrough speculation into your condition. Are you buried alive? Why? Are \nyou alive? Are you accelerating through space in a you-shaped windowless\n vessel? What is your shape? Are you a flicker of light on the horizon \nof a black hole? Where is she? Has he lost all he loved? Speculation via\n thought becomes reality. Including historical, scientific, and found \nmaterials and images, ARTIFACT COLLECTIVE is a fictional and \nnon-fictional exploration of quantum theory, cosmology, possible \nfutures, intellectual property, interwoven presents, the commons, the \nindividual and collective mind, and the self. ARTIFACT COLLECTIVE is a \ncorpus.

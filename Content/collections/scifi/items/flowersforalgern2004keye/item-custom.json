  "spacecraft_description": "Flowers for Algernon is a poignant science fiction novel that follows Charlie Gordon, a 32-year-old man with an IQ of 68 who undergoes experimental brain surgery to enhance his intelligence. The story is told through Charlie's progress reports, which document his transformation from a mentally disabled janitor to a genius and back again. As Charlie's intelligence increases dramatically, he realizes that his coworkers have been mocking him rather than befriending him, and he discovers the painful truth about human nature and society's treatment of those who are different. The experimental procedure proves temporary, and Charlie gradually loses his enhanced abilities, ultimately reverting to his original state but with a deeper understanding of human dignity and compassion.",

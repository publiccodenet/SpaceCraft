  "description": "Rei Yokoyamada is a 16 year old high school student who wants to follow in his movie producer father's footsteps by making a movie to submit to a film festival. After a classmate asked to take the role of the female lead bows out, he wanders the neighborhood and sees posters announcing that Papico (real name \"Chiho Johansson\"), a buxom AV actress that Rei is a fan of, lives in the area. Events soon transpire that cause Rei and Chiho to meet in person. The two quickly become friends and start chatting online. Then Chiho finds a middle-aged man in his underwear bleeding on the sidewalk. When she tries to help, the man turns into a doll, leaving her with a DVD and a mysterious device implanted into her wrist that allows her to turn into a giant. Yes, really. I wasn't making that up.",

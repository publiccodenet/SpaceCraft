  "spacecraft_description": "Gideon the Ninth is a genre-defying debut that combines gothic horror, space opera, and necromantic fantasy into what has been memorably described as \"lesbian necromancers in space.\" The novel follows Gideon Nav, an irreverent swordswoman, and Harrowhark Nonagesimus, a powerful necromancer, as they travel to the decaying First House on a distant planet. There, representatives from nine Houses must compete in deadly trials to become Lyctorsâ€”immortal servants of the undying Emperor. Set in a universe where necromancy is both science and art, the story takes place in a haunted gothic palace filled with ancient secrets and murderous constructs. As participants begin dying mysteriously, Gideon and Harrow must navigate complex political alliances while confronting their own bitter past. This brilliant fusion of mystery, horror, and science fiction features space travel, ancient technology, and a magic system based on manipulating death energy.",

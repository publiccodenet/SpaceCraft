  "description": "The Acolyte was a fanzine edited by Francis Towner Laney from 1942-1946 (a total of 14 issues), dedicated to articles about horror and fantasy fiction, with particular emphasis on H. P. Lovecraft and his circle, and occasional fiction and poetry. Many consider it to have been the premier fanzine of the early 1940’s.

Lovecraft) in June 1934 by Robert H. Barlow. It contains pseudonymous references to many of them (such as David H. Keller appearing as \"D. H. Killer\" and A. Hyatt Verrill as \"A. Hijacked Barrell\"). This reprinting contains a \"Glossary Of Names\" which identifies the real people who were featured as characters in the story. In mid-1934, Lovecraft denied writing this piece, although he was believed to be at least one of the authors by August Derleth, Clark Ashton Smith, and others. 12 · The Law Of The Swamp · Ruby Diehr · pm 13 · Ervool · Fritz Leiber, Jr. · ss 16 · The Grey Mouser [Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser] · Fritz Leiber, Jr. · pm 17 · Howard Phillips Lovecraft [H.P.

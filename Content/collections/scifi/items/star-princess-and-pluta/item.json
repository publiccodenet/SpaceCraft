  "description": "Obscure coloring book from the early 80's which takes elements of Star Wars and Buck Rogers and transplants them into a girl's fantasy sci-fi story about a young girl and her horse who are transformed into an adult space heroine and diplomat and her robot companion who go off on various adventures. Although this franchise wasn't very successful, it's a nice glimpse of an attempt to get in on the fledgling \"space fantasy\" market.",

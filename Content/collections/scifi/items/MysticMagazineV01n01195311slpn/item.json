  "description": "Mystic Magazine was primarily an occult non-fiction magazine which, in its early issues, was about half fiction and half articles. After the fourth issue the fiction was greatly reduced and appeared only sporadically after the seventh issue. Later issues contain articles by Richard S. Shaver that may be of interest to some collectors. The magazine settled firmly into a non-fiction format about the time that Palmer sold his interest in its chief competitor, Fate , and the title was changed to Search with the October 1956 issue. It was still running at the time of Palmer’s death in 1977.   CONTENTS: Mystic Magazine [#1, November 1953] (35¢, 132pp, digest, cover by J.

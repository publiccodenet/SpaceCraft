  "description": "This book, years in the making, gives girls and young women a better understanding of who they are and the kinds of people they may have to deal with in their lives. As we're not born knowing what is explained in this short book, hopefully it will provide insight, helping women to make wise choices in their life. The understanding of a negative situation often helps us to make peace with it and experience forgiveness - which ultimately benefits everyone. This book confirms that women have integrity and strength - and gives examples of why this is so.Â  Women have had to endure abuse throughout history but have still remained strong; raising families, positively contributing to society (even though they often don't get credit for their accomplishments), etc.",

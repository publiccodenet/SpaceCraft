  "description": "Have you ever delivered meals to shut-in trolls or warlocks? Ever solved a shaman's murder by details you noticed at the lizard orgy? Ever made one of those wagers with a deity where you just know a dozen mortals will end up insane or beheaded, daughters marrying fathers, cousins stabbing grandmothers, and almost always, somebody has to lose an eye? What if you could bend a paperclip into an intricate, spring-loaded pattern that would allow it to walk across your desk, write reports for you, brew coffee and do your entire job? Escape from your dayjob into this collection of 2d6 short stories, 5 recipes and a novella.",

  "spacecraft_description": "Contact is Carl Sagan's only science fiction novel, written by the renowned astronomer and SETI researcher who brought scientific rigor to the story of humanity's first contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. Astronomer Ellie Arroway detects a radio signal from the star Vega containing the first 261 prime numbers, proving its artificial origin. The message turns out to be far more complex, containing blueprints for a mysterious machine capable of transporting five humans. The discovery sparks global debates between scientists, religious fundamentalists, and governments about whether to build the device. The novel explores the intersection of science and spirituality, the nature of proof and faith, and humanity's place in the cosmos. Sagan weaves together themes of SETI research, religious belief, scientific skepticism, and the search for meaning in the universe. The story suggests that the universe itself may contain messages about its creation, hinting that even an atheist scientist like Sagan could find wonder in the possibility of cosmic purpose and intelligence beyond our own.",

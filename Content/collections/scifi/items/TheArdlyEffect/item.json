The characters are a joy to read and that first chapter just has to be read. The book is full of little surprises and some of the reveals are truly entertaining. I don't want to talk too much about the plot because I think it should be saved for when you read this book. ... Baker has plenty of material for the follow on books and could quite happily do a prequel as well. I really hope people will read this book and it provided me with so much enjoyment. One of the best books I've read in a long time.\"",

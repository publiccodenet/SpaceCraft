    "During the Third Age, the Age of Prophecy, the world and time hang in the balance, in peril of falling under the Shadow. The peaceful villagers of Emond's Field pay little heed to rumours of war in the western lands until a savage attack by troll-like minions of the Dark One forces three young men to confront a destiny which has its origins in the time known as The Breaking of the World. This richly detailed fantasy presents a fully realized, complex adventure which will appeal to fans of classic quests",

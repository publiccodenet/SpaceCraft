  "spacecraft_description": "The War of the Worlds is a seminal science fiction novel depicting the first major alien invasion story. Martians, driven by their dying planet's conditions, launch a devastating attack on Earth using advanced technology including giant fighting machines called tripods, heat-rays, and poisonous black smoke. The story follows an unnamed narrator through the chaos as human civilization crumbles before the Martians' superior weaponry and tactics. Despite humanity's military efforts proving futile, the invasion ultimately fails when the Martians succumb to terrestrial bacteria, having no immunity to Earth's microorganisms. Wells crafted this tale as both thrilling adventure and social commentary, exploring themes of imperialism, technological hubris, and human vulnerability. The novel established many tropes of the alien invasion genre and remains influential in science fiction, demonstrating how the smallest organisms can defeat the mightiest invaders.",

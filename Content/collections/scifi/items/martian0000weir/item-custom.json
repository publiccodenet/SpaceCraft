  "spacecraft_description": "The Martian is Andy Weir's hard science fiction novel about astronaut Mark Watney, who becomes stranded alone on Mars when his crew evacuates during a severe dust storm, presuming him dead. With limited supplies intended for a much shorter mission, Watney must use his skills as a botanist and engineer to survive on the hostile planet for over 500 days until the next Mars mission arrives. He grows potatoes in Martian soil using crew waste as fertilizer, creates water by burning rocket fuel, and modifies equipment to extend his survival. Meanwhile, NASA discovers he's alive through satellite imagery and works frantically to mount a rescue mission. The novel is celebrated for its scientific accuracy, detailed problem-solving, and optimistic portrayal of human ingenuity. Watney's humor and determination in the face of overwhelming odds make this both a thrilling survival story and an inspiring testament to the power of science, engineering, and the human spirit to overcome seemingly impossible challenges.",

  "description": "The Journal Of Science-Fiction was a science fiction fanzine which lasted for four issues from 1951 to 1953. It was published in Chicago by Charles Freudenthal, and edited by Freudenthal and Edward Wood (of no relation to the infamous movie director, as far as I know). Lester Fried was co-editor of the magazine's first issue. This final issue features an article on British fantasy paperbacks, an appreciation of Richard Matheson's work by Robert Bloch, and material relating to the 1952 Tenth Anniversary World Science Fiction Convention which had been held in Chicago. The issue includes thirty photographs taken at the convention and the text of guest of honor Hugo Gernsback's address to the convention. Also included in the issue is a listing of the contents of the science fiction and fantasy magazines which were published in 1952. It's amazing how many different titles were being published that year. CONTENTS: The Journal Of Science-Fiction [v 1 #4, 1953] ed.

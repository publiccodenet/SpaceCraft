## Planned Future Enhancements

- **Touch Gesture Support**: Pinch-to-zoom, multi-touch rotation
- **Snap-to-Point**: Gravitational snapping to nearby points of interest
- **Path Animation**: Automated camera movements along predefined paths
- **Tilt View**: Optional perspective shift at closer zoom levels
- **Multi-user Navigation**: Collaborative camera control

## Ballistic Link Navigation

CraftSpace implements a playful yet practical "cannon-like" system for navigating between distant points:

### Concept

- **Cannon Launch Metaphor**: Links act like Mario-style cannons, launching the viewer on ballistic trajectories
- **Spatial Awareness**: The journey itself communicates spatial relationships between content
- **Dynamic Zoom**: Camera zooms out during flight to provide context and manage perceived speed
- **User Intervention**: Ability to take control at any point during the journey

### Launch Mechanics

- **Initial Boost**: Activating a link imparts precisely calculated velocity to the camera
- **Parabolic Trajectory**: Camera follows a graceful arc through the content space
- **Dynamic Altitude**: Height (zoom level) follows a predefined curve:
  - Initial zoom-out as launch begins
  - Maximum altitude/zoom-out at midpoint
  - Gradual descent and zoom-in as destination approaches
- **Speed Profiling**: Velocity varies throughout journey for dramatic effect and readability

### Atlas-Optimized Flight Paths

The altitude curve is precisely engineered to optimize performance and caching:

- **Resolution-Synchronized Altitudes**: Flight path altitudes correspond directly to texture atlas resolution tiers
- **Rapid Initial Ascent**: Quick zoom-out transitions away from high-resolution textures at the origin
- **Cruising Altitude**: Maintains height that utilizes already-cached low-resolution atlases during transit
- **Steep Final Descent**: Creates a "tunnel-like" descent effect while loading destination high-resolution textures
- **Cache-Aware Routing**: Path calculation considers which texture regions are likely already loaded

This performance-optimized approach means:

- **Reduced Loading Time**: Leverages already-cached atlas textures during most of the journey
- **Seamless Experience**: Minimizes visual popping or texture loading delays
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Avoids unnecessary high-resolution texture loading during transit
- **Perceptual Optimization**: The high-speed mid-journey portion happens at altitudes where texture detail is less critical

### User Control During Flight

- **Grab Control**: Click/tap during flight to immediately stop and hover
- **Gradual Braking**: Press and hold to gradually decelerate
- **Mid-Flight Steering**: Drag to alter trajectory during flight
- **Superman Mode**: Take complete control mid-flight to "fly" manually

### Visual Feedback

- **Trajectory Indication**: Optional arc showing planned path
- **Speed Lines**: Visual effects indicating velocity
- **Altitude Shadowing**: Ground shadow indicating current height/zoom
- **Destination Marker**: Visual indicator of where you'll land

### Integration with Navigation System

The ballistic link system integrates seamlessly with the standard navigation controls:

- Uses the same underlying physics system with specialized parameters
- Transitions smoothly between guided and manual navigation
- Preserves momentum when taking manual control
- Supports the same stopping and throwing mechanics

This approach makes navigating between distant points not just functional but entertaining, while reinforcing spatial relationships in the content map and maintaining the user's mental model of the space.

This navigation system provides a solid foundation for single-user exploration of content in a WebGL browser environment, with future expansion planned for more advanced interaction patterns and multi-user scenarios.

Now, it's the dawn of the 5th wave, and on a lonely stretch of highway, Cassie runs from Them. The beings who only look human, who roam the countryside killing anyone they see. Who have scattered Earth's last survivors. To stay alone is to stay alive, Cassie believes, until she meets Evan Walker. Beguiling and mysterious, Evan Walker may be Cassie's only hope for rescuing her brother -- or even saving herself. But Cassie must choose: between trust and despair, between defiance and surrender, between life and death. To give up or to get up",

But the commercial value of this scourge has never been in doubt, especially when the special properties of the Alien Queen's royal jelly are discovered. Will Mankind once again risk its very survival as a species in order to sleep with the Alien? Dark Horse Comics' critically acclaimed  Aliens  series set the bar for how the universe of a popular film could be expanded through graphic fiction.  Aliens Omnibus  Volume 2 collects more of these exciting series in a value-priced, quality-format omnibus, featuring over four hundred story pages in full color. Includes the complete story arcs of  Genocide ,  Harvest , and the never-before-collected, epic-length  Colonial Marines .",

Assembled by Steven Meretzky of Infocom. During his time at Infocom, Steve Meretzky meticulously gathered thousands of pages of notes, journals, maps, memos, forms and other printable materials related to all aspects of Infocom, and kept them in his basement for decades. During the GET LAMP production, Jason Scott scanned in roughly 9,000 pages of these documents across a number of months, borrowing the materials from Steve and scanning them as quickly as possible, at around 600dpi. From these scans, a portion was used in the GET LAMP movie to illustrate various scenes and descriptions by interviewees. From the Wikipedia entry : The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an interactive fiction video game based on the comedic science fiction series of the same name. It was designed by series creator Douglas Adams and Infocom's Steve Meretzky, and was first released in 1984 for the Apple II, Macintosh, Commodore 64, CP/M, DOS, Amiga, Atari 8-bit and Atari ST. It is Infocom's fourteenth game. The game loosely mirrors a portion of the series' plot, representing most of the events in the first book. Arthur Dent wakes up one day to find his house about to be destroyed by a construction crew to make way for a new bypass. His friend Ford Prefect, who is secretly an extraterrestrial, helps to calm Arthur down and hitches them a ride on one of the ships in the approaching Vogon constructor fleet, moments before the fleet destroys the Earth to make way for a new hyperspace bypass.",

Ist nicht nur die Mondlandung eine Luege der US-Propaganda, sondern das gesamte Bild, das wir vom Weltraum und unserem Sonnensystem haben? Führen uns die westlichen Massenmedien und die Schulastronomie vor allem seit den 50er Jahren hinter`s Licht mit \"ihrem\" Bild vom Weltall? \"Die Hohlwelttheorie\" ist lesenswerter, als man auf den ersten Blick vermuten koennte!",

Was auf den ersten Blick wie komplette Spinnerei klingt, macht beim Lesen des Buches mehr als nachdenklich, denn die Thesen Langs haben Hand und Fuss! Ist nicht nur die Mondlandung eine Luege der US-Propaganda, sondern das gesamte Bild, das wir vom Weltraum und unserem Sonnensystem haben? Führen uns die westlichen Massenmedien und die Schulastronomie vor allem seit den 50er Jahren hinter`s Licht mit \"ihrem\" Bild vom Weltall? \"Die Hohlwelttheorie\" ist lesenswerter, als man auf den ersten Blick vermuten koennte!",

From the humorous to the adventurous to the mind-bending to the touching, the writers explore what the world would be like if a blood test could predict your death.  But don't think for a moment this is a book entirely composed of stories about people meeting their ironic dooms. There is some of that, of course. But more than that, this is a genre-hopping collection of tales about people who have learned more about themselves then perhaps they should have, and how that knowledge affects their relationships, their perception of the world, and how they feel about themselves.  Features thirty-four stories by Randall Munroe, Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw, Tom Francis, Camille Alexa, Erin McKean, James L.

          "description": "Since the end of the Second World War—and particularly over the last decade—Japanese science fiction has strongly influenced global popular culture. Unlike American and British science fiction, its most popular examples have been visual—from Gojira (Godzilla) and Astro Boy in the 1950s and 1960s to the anime masterpieces Akira and Ghost in the Shell of the 1980s and 1990s—while little attention has been paid to a vibrant tradition of prose science fiction in Japan. Robot Ghosts and Wired Dreams remedies this neglect with a rich exploration of the genre that connects prose science fiction to contemporary anime. Bringing together Western scholars and leading Japanese critics, this groundbreaking work traces the beginnings, evolution, and future direction of science fiction in Japan, its major schools and authors, cultural origins and relationship to its Western counterparts, the role of the genre in the formation of Japan’s national and political identity, and its unique fan culture. Covering a remarkable range of texts—from the 1930s fantastic detective fiction of Yumeno Kyûsaku to the cross-culturally produced and marketed film and video game franchise Final Fantasy—this book firmly establishes Japanese science fiction as a vital and exciting genre.",

Oh, yeah, and make as much money as possible on whatever unsavory gigs people will hire her for. But then one of her few friends asks a favor: help him track down a stolen math proof. One that, in the wrong hands, could crumble encryption protocols worldwide and utterly collapse global commerce.  Cas is immediately ducking car bombs and men with AKs -- this is the type of math people are willing to kill for, and the U.S. government wants it as much as the bad guys do. But all that pales compared to what Cas learns from delving into the proof. Because the more she works on the case, the more she realizes something is very, very wrong . . . with her.  For the first time, Cas questions her own bizarre mathematical abilities. How far they reach. How they tie into the pieces of herself that are broken -- or missing.  How the new proof might knit her brain back together . . . while making her more powerful than she's ever imagined.  Desperate to fix her fractured self, Cas dives into the tangled layers of higher mathematics, frantic for numerical power that might not even be possible -- and willing to do anything, betray anyone, to get it.

          "description": "The Face In The Abyss is a fantasy novel by American writer A. Merritt. It is composed of a novelette with the same title and its sequel, \"The Snake Mother\". It was first published in its complete form in 1931 by Horace Liveright. The novelette \"The Face In The Abyss\" originally appeared in the magazine Argosy All-Story Weekly in the September 8, 1923 issue. The sequel \"The Snake Mother\" was originally serialized in seven parts in Argosy beginning with the October 25, 1930 issue. The novel concerns American mining engineer Nicholas Graydon. While searching for lost Inca treasure in South America, he encounters Suarra, handmaiden to the Snake Mother of Yu-Atlanchi. She leads Graydon to an abyss where Nimir, the Lord of Evil is imprisoned in a face of gold. While Graydon's companions are transformed by the face into globules of gold due to their greed, he is saved by Suarra and the Snake Mother whom he joins in their struggle against Nimir. Abraham Grace Merritt was born January 20, 1884 in Beverly, New Jersey.  Although he only wrote eight novels and a handful of short stories in his career, nonetheless he is considered one of the giants of imaginative fiction.  I like to describe his writing as Edgar Rice Burroughs meets H.P.

After about a year he returned to Philadelphia and resumed work for the Inquirer.  Merritt's talent was \"feature writing\" and he rose rapidly covering murders, suicides, hangings, mysteries, romances and political stories.  Within six years he had risen to the night city editor and came under the notice of Morrill Goddard, the editor of The American Weekly.  The Weekly was the magazine or Sunday supplement of the Hearst newspaper chain. Goddard hired him as assistant editor in 1912.  He would continue in this position until Goddard unexpectedly died in 1937, upon which Merritt was promoted to take his place.  The American Weekly was 20 pages, 21'' X 15'' in size and was printed on newsprint in full color.  It had a \"newspaper\" circulation of 6.5 million weekly subscribers, but boasted of over 50 million readers, making it the most widely read magazine in the country, if not the world.  It was filled with scantily clad showgirls and movie stars, science articles, historical essays, scandals and tales of murder and suspense, as well as beautiful full-page color advertisements.  In the 1930s Merritt noticed the drawings of Virgil Finlay in Weird Tales and hired him to be an illustrator for the Weekly.  The Parade magazine that currently comes in many American Sunday newspapers, is a pale comparison.   Merritt thrived in this milieu and was well like by those working under him, because he acted as a buffer between them and the often gruff Goddard.  It was during his time as assistant editor that he found time to write his fiction.  Merritt wrote entirely for his own pleasure and ego.  He didn't need the money.  He was making $100,000 a year at a time when $1,500 would have been a respectable middle-class income.  His first fiction writing were short stories beginning with Through The Dragon Glass (1917) , a superb, 5,000 word fantasy about a strange civilization reached by passing through a Chinese jade ring.  This was followed by The People Of The Pit (1918) and Three Lines Of Old French (1919), both masterpieces of short fiction that displayed his organizational and narrative abilities and an ability to create mood with few words, probably a result of his journalistic training.  In between the two he wrote The Moon Pool (1918) a short novelette that launched his writing career in earnest.  So popular was this story that he quickly followed it with a sequel, The Conquest Of The Moon Pool (1919).  Both tell the story of a living, thinking force of pure energy who can travel on moonlight, who uses a pool on a remote Pacific island, as a portal between our reality and another dimension.  The stories concern efforts to rescue people who had been sucked through this portal and the world of the other dimension.  Nothing like this, and as well written as this, had ever appeared in popular fiction before.  Merritt followed this with The Metal Monster (1920) a story about a huge metallic life-form, to whom puny humans are mere playthings and who could cleanse the Earth of them at a whim.  This was followed by The Face In The Abyss, a 33,000 word novelette concerning an expedition to the Andes mountains of Peru in search of the lost Inca treasure of Atahualpa, for which Merritt was paid $500.  Since this story is the purpose of this posting, I don't want to go to deeply into the plot.  Needless to say, it is considered by many to be Merritt's masterpiece, myself included.  Although Merritt himself considered The Dwellers In The Mirage (1932) to be his best work.  It took Merritt eight years to write a sequel, which appeared as The Snake Mother in 1930.  Both are included in this post.  Merritt's other novels include The Ship Of Ishtar (1924), Seven Footprints To Satan (1927), Burn Witch Burn (1932) and Creep, Shadow (1934).  This marked the end of Merritt's career as a fiction writer, although he started, but, because of the pressure of putting out a weekly magazine, never had the time to complete two more novels... The Fox Woman and The Black Wheel.  Both of which were completed posthumously, with mixed results, by the artist Hannes Bok. Merritt must have been an interesting man.  He was remembered by co-workers as a kindly and sympathetic boss, who kept a collection of odd musical instruments at the office and had a love of stinky cheese and organ meat sandwiches.  He had one of the largest collections of books, in several languages, on magic, sorcery and witchcraft in the world, and frequently lectured on these subjects at major universities.  He was also an authority on folklore and mythology, much of which worked it's way into his writing.  He maintained a garden with hundreds of types of poisonous plants from all over the world.  He raised bees for honey.  He maintained homes in New York, Florida, the Bahamas and South America and traveled extensively as time permitted, acquiring  collections of weapons, carvings, and primitive masks during his travels.  He was twice married to women, both of whom were named Eleanore/Eleanor and raised an adopted daughter from his first marriage. He died suddenly of a heart attack, at the age of 59, at his vacation home in Indian Beach, Florida in 1943.",

            "description": "The Face In The Abyss is a fantasy novel by American writer A. Merritt. It is composed of a novelette with the same title and its sequel, \"The Snake Mother\". It was first published in its complete form in 1931 by Horace Liveright. The novelette \"The Face In The Abyss\" originally appeared in the magazine Argosy All-Story Weekly in the September 8, 1923 issue. The sequel \"The Snake Mother\" was originally serialized in seven parts in Argosy beginning with the October 25, 1930 issue. The novel concerns American mining engineer Nicholas Graydon. While searching for lost Inca treasure in South America, he encounters Suarra, handmaiden to the Snake Mother of Yu-Atlanchi. She leads Graydon to an abyss where Nimir, the Lord of Evil is imprisoned in a face of gold. While Graydon's companions are transformed by the face into globules of gold due to their greed, he is saved by Suarra and the Snake Mother whom he joins in their struggle against Nimir. Abraham Grace Merritt was born January 20, 1884 in Beverly, New Jersey.  Although he only wrote eight novels and a handful of short stories in his career, nonetheless he is considered one of the giants of imaginative fiction.  I like to describe his writing as Edgar Rice Burroughs meets H.P. Lovecraft, via Clark Ashton Smith.  His novels and stories are a subtle blending of dream-like fantasy and fast moving adventure.  Over the years he was much imitated, but seldom equaled.  He had a typically bucolic childhood in small town America.  His father's family had fought for the Union during the Civil War, his mother's for the Confederacy, which made for some interesting family gatherings.  Last Of The Mohicans author James Fenimore Cooper was his great-great grand uncle by his mother.  His family moved to Philadelphia, about 25 miles south of Beverly, in 1894.  Merritt was a voracious reader and had a facility for speed reading, which came in handy later in life.  He graduated high school  with high marks in literature and \"incredibly low ones in mathematics.\"  He originally intended to be a lawyer but soured on this upon realizing that he would sometimes be required to defend the guilty.  His love of reading led to him apprenticing for the Philadelphia Inquirer.  It was during his apprenticeship that he was the accidental witness of a crime that frightened him so badly that he fled the country to Mexico where he spent a year drinking, partying and exploring Aztec and Mayan ruins.  He would never explain exactly what had frightened him so much, but late in life admitted that it had to do with a powerful political figure.  He would draw heavily on his Aztec and Mayan explorations in his writings.

Once anyone hears of a project to make a Klingon Bible, the question that comes up is \"why?\" Certainly there is no need for such a version, as there is a need for a Bible in English, Spanish, German, or any other \"real\" language. There is no person who would only be able to access the scriptures in Klingon. But in the study of artificial languages, translating standard works of literature like the Bible is often done, and for two reasons. First, it is a way to exercise and develop the language, and second, it helps to develop a body of literature in that language. This literature can then be used and referred to by people learning and using the language. For some, there can be other benefits. Though this kind of translation might seem frivolous, the work of producing such a translation can have devotional value even if the translation is never used. The effort of reading the scriptures and considering their meaning for a translation cannot fail to benefit the translator by helping him or her develop a deeper understanding of the text. The Klingon language community has produced at least three efforts in this direction. The Klingon Language Institute (http://www.kli.org) organized a long-term project to translate the Bible. Currently on hiatus, this project has yielded only a few books, for example, the Gospel of Mark. In addition, the Rev. Glen Prochel published a book, Good News for the Warrior Race, which presents the gospels and other selected scriptures in parallel with a \"Star Trek\" English paraphrase. Lastly, the project presented here, the Klingon Language Version, is actually a relexification of the World English Bible and serves as a demonstration of what a complete Klingon Bible would look like. A table of the most frequently occurring words (used more than 100 times) was translated, word by word, into Klingon. This table was used to transform the WEB into Klingon. Though it is not a grammatical Klingon text (actually it is more of a pidgin-Klingon, mixing English vocabulary and grammar with Klingon) it does provide vocabulary which can be used in doing a proper Klingon translation.

          "description": "Susan Atkins, Captain of Starship NOVA, is on a special mission to transport prisoner CX589 to the planet Troidon. It is Earth Year 2288, and she and her crew must ride a wormhole in order to propel themselves into the future to reach Troidon. While time travel is impossible, The Great Rip is an exception. Instead of jumping onto another timeline, they travel forward and back sixty five years, keeping things balanced.  Communications are coming from the United Earth Alliance in Brussels, from Admiral Niemir Mazur, who is overseeing Susan’s objective. The captain expresses concerns they are delivering the prisoner to a planet that will surely execute him, but Niemir is confident in Susan’s abilities. Troidon is Earth-like, with a similar civilization and belief system. Scientists and spiritual Leaders were once at odds over the actuality of intelligent life in the universe until Earth's Voyager 1 began orbiting their skies centuries ago. The bible-like Book of Beginnings was Troyoris’ doctrine, and claimed Troidon was the only habitable planet. First fearful, citizens then revolted when they realized the book’s Christ-like Helm wasn’t a savior, he was a fraud. After Susan successfully delivers prisoner CX589 to the Leader, an accident occurs on the return trip and she and her crew journey back hundreds of years to the past. Their only hope in getting home requires placing their destiny into the hands of Professor Harris, a 21tst century scientist who used laser light to twist time and may have inadvertently created an instrument for transport.  Meanwhile, the past and future collide in present-day Norway and the results are catastrophic. Not only is there a great loss of life, but NOVA has been inadvertently glimpsed by millions and now the crew’s existence is compromised. Will they be able to survive the trip home with the questionable abilities of the Professor’s invention? And even if they do, will their lives be forever altered by the imprint left in the past?  The Next Step  zips through space at warp speed toward a catastrophic ending where timelines, wormholes and lives all hang in the balance, dependent on both faith and science for a favorable ending.

Avatar Yangchen has succeeded in bringing a measure of stability to Bin-Er, but her successes have been limited to a single city, and rumors concerning Unanimity—a weapon capable of total obliteration—have led to increasing tensions among the Four Nations. Desperate to restore diplomacy, Yangchen attempts to de-escalate hostilities between heads of state. But in the wake of a brutal assassination and the freeing of Unanimity, Yangchen is forced to bring Kavik—the trusted former companion whose betrayal crushed her—back into her fold. As the Four Nations teeter on the brink of conflict and she begins to unravel the power-hungry Zongdu Chaisee’s true agenda, Yangchen is forced to measure the worth of humanity, and how much can be sacrificed in the name of balance. This taut and provocative fourth installment in the Chronicles of the Avatar series follows Avatar Yangchen as she charts the course of her legacy, finally making peace with her choices and facing Avatarhood with the courage it demands.",

          "description": "Lenie Clarke-rifter, avenger, amphibious deep-sea cyborg-has destroyed the world. Once exploited for her psychological addiction to dangerous environments, she emerged in the wake of a nuclear blast to serve up vendetta from the ocean floor. The horror she unleashed-an ancient, apocalyptic microbe called ßehemoth- has been free in the world for half a decade now, devouring the biosphere from the bottom up. North America lies in ruins beneath the thumb of an omnipotent psychopath. Digital monsters have taken Clarke's name, wreaking havoc throughout the decimated remnants of something that was once called Internet. Governments have fallen across the globe; warlords and suicide cults rise from the ashes, pledging fealty to the Meltdown Madonna. All because five years ago, Lenie Clarke had a score to settle.  But she has learned something in the meantime: she destroyed the world for a fallacy.  Now, cowering at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, rifters and the technoindustrial \"corpses\" who created them hide from a world in its death throes. But they cannot hide forever: something is tracking them, down amongst the lightless cliffs and trenches of the Midatlantic Ridge. The consequences of past acts reach inexorably towards the very bottom of the world, and Lenie Clarke must finally confront the mess she made.  Redemption doesn't come easy with the blood of a world on your hands. But even after five years in purgatory, Lenie Clarke is still Lenie Clarke. There will be consequences for anyone who gets in her way-and worse ones, perhaps, if she succeeds. . . .  Behemoth was originally published in two volumes,  Behemoth: ß-max and  Behemoth: Seppukku .

Cette série de science-fiction raconte les aventures d'un adolescent du XX e siècle qui se réveille deux siècles plus tard. Cette série d'aventure et de science-fiction connaît un net succès en Espagne où elle contribue au renouveau de la bande dessinée espagnole. Elle est ensuite publiée en français dans le journal de Tintin . Trame Fils d'un scientifique du XX e siècle, Dani Futuro, alors appelé Daniel Blancor, est victime d'un accident d'avion . Il est pris dans les glaces du Cercle polaire arctique et se retrouve momifié 1 , 2 . L'action commence en 2110, lorsque le héros se réveille après 157 ans d'hibernation 3 . Dani Futuro apprend alors à vivre au XXII e siècle. Il s'y fait plusieurs amis : le docteur Dosian, qui l'a découvert et devient son fidèle compagnon ; Iris, la charmante nièce du docteur ; et Jules, un robot 1 , 2 . À cette époque, les progrès scientiques ont éradiqué presque toutes les catastrophes naturelles terrestres. Mais il subsiste des menaces et des injustices contre lesquelles Dani Futuro lutte courageusement, avec l'aide de ses amis 4 . Dans La Planète des malédictions , une société d'exploitation épuise les ressources en bois d'une planète, ce qui provoque un grave dérèglement climatique amenant une période glaciaire . Le problème est résolu en laissant proliférer une plante autochtone qui recycle l'oxygène natif 5 . L'épisode la fin d'un monde montre Dani Futuro se rendant dans une planète éloignée où deux factions rivales luttent pour exploiter de plus en plus de ressources 5 . Auteurs Victor Mora est l'auteur des scénarios de ce « ressuscité du passé » , d'abord sous le pseudonyme de Eugenio Roca 1 , 3 . Ses scénarios sont robustes, avec de multiples rebondissements dans le fantastique, déployant les volets successifs de l'intrigue 4 . Carlos Giménez en signe les illustrations, de façon semi-réaliste 1 . Avec un style qui a spectaculairement évolué, il se révèle comme un artiste clé de la bande dessinée espagnole, et son graphisme magnifique procure des pages d'anthologie 3 , avec la conception de paysages imaginaires très élaborés où évoluent les personnages ainsi que des machines futuristes nouvelles à chaque page 4 . Dans la version française, les scénarios de Mora sont adaptés par Greg 6 . Impact de la série Dani Futuro obtient un succès considérable, dans le genre futuriste 3 . C'est une des principales séries de science-fiction qui sont à l'origine du fort renouveau de la bande dessinée espagnole 7 . Le personnage de Dani Futuro incarne un nouveau genre de héros, qui tout en étant les héritiers de leurs prédécesseurs, se retrouvent affranchis des limitations idéologiques. La mode de la science-fiction dans les années 1970 permet d'aborder le thème de l'oppression par le biais de la fable futuriste. Tout en procurant des revenus économiques non négligeables, cette série marque aussi le début de la prise de conscience des professionnels de la bande dessinée pour un engagement politique dans les années de transition après l'oppression franquiste 8 . Politiquement, la série dénonce aussi les méfaits de l'exploitation abusive des ressources naturelles et leur impact sur le changement climatique, notamment dans les épisodes la Planète des malédictions et la Fin d'un monde 5 . Publication Les aventures de Dani Futuro paraissent d'abord fin 1969 dans l'Almanach 1970 de la revue espagnole Gaceta Junior   (es) , en un récit de quatre planches 1 . Mais ce n'est là qu'une sorte de présentation, sans grand rapport avec ce qui sera la trame principale de la série 4 . Plusieurs histoires complètes paraissent ensuite dans le même journal 1 . La première d'entre elles paraît dans l'hebdomadaire numéro 75 en mars 1970, et raconte l'origine du héros comme sa situation dans la nouvelle époque 4 . La série présente tous les ingrédients pour devenir un succès auprès des critiques et du public, avec un scénario très solide plein de situations fantastiques à multiples facettes, dans une mise en scène graphique alliant les somptueux paysages et les engins futuristes 4 . Mais les ventes de la Gaceta Junior sont en forte baisse. La publication s'arrête au numéro 81 de l'hebdomadaire, et l'avenir de la série semble bien compromis 4 . Plusieurs autres récits de Dani Futuro sont publiés ensuite par El Diario de la Vanguardia et dans l'hebdomadaire Tío Vivo   (es) 1 . Mais les droits sur les personnages sont inexplicablement vendus, et les auteurs doivent porter l'affaire devant les tribunaux. Pendant ce temps, les auteurs, voulant continuer sur le même créneau, publient l'aventure d'Iris d'Andromède et essayent de lancer une nouvelle bande dessinée, Ray 25 , sur une intrigue similaire 4 . Une fois réglée la question des droits, les récits de Dani Futuro paraissent ensuite en français dans le journal de Tintin , à partir de 1971. Greg , le directeur du journal, croit au potentiel de la série, mais le lectorat de Tintin lui fait un accueil mitigé, et la publication dans l'hebdomadaire s'arrête en 1976 1 .

Politiquement, la série dénonce aussi les méfaits de l'exploitation abusive des ressources naturelles et leur impact sur le changement climatique, notamment dans les épisodes la Planète des malédictions et la Fin d'un monde 5 . Publication Les aventures de Dani Futuro paraissent d'abord fin 1969 dans l'Almanach 1970 de la revue espagnole Gaceta Junior   (es) , en un récit de quatre planches 1 . Mais ce n'est là qu'une sorte de présentation, sans grand rapport avec ce qui sera la trame principale de la série 4 . Plusieurs histoires complètes paraissent ensuite dans le même journal 1 . La première d'entre elles paraît dans l'hebdomadaire numéro 75 en mars 1970, et raconte l'origine du héros comme sa situation dans la nouvelle époque 4 . La série présente tous les ingrédients pour devenir un succès auprès des critiques et du public, avec un scénario très solide plein de situations fantastiques à multiples facettes, dans une mise en scène graphique alliant les somptueux paysages et les engins futuristes 4 . Mais les ventes de la Gaceta Junior sont en forte baisse. La publication s'arrête au numéro 81 de l'hebdomadaire, et l'avenir de la série semble bien compromis 4 . Plusieurs autres récits de Dani Futuro sont publiés ensuite par El Diario de la Vanguardia et dans l'hebdomadaire Tío Vivo   (es) 1 . Mais les droits sur les personnages sont inexplicablement vendus, et les auteurs doivent porter l'affaire devant les tribunaux. Pendant ce temps, les auteurs, voulant continuer sur le même créneau, publient l'aventure d'Iris d'Andromède et essayent de lancer une nouvelle bande dessinée, Ray 25 , sur une intrigue similaire 4 . Une fois réglée la question des droits, les récits de Dani Futuro paraissent ensuite en français dans le journal de Tintin , à partir de 1971. Greg , le directeur du journal, croit au potentiel de la série, mais le lectorat de Tintin lui fait un accueil mitigé, et la publication dans l'hebdomadaire s'arrête en 1976 1 .

Gary Webb pushed his investigation even further in his book, \"Dark Alliance: The CIA, The Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion.\" Drawing from then newly declassified documents, undercover DEA audio and videotapes that had never been publicly released, federal court testimony, and interviews, Webb demonstrates how our government knowingly allowed massive amounts of drugs and money to change hands at the expense of our communities.

Three-Body was released to great acclaim including coverage in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. It was also named a finalist for the Nebula Award, making it the first translated novel to be nominated for a major SF award since Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities in 1976. Now this epic trilogy concludes with Death's End . Half a century after the Doomsday Battle, the uneasy balance of Dark Forest Deterrence keeps the Trisolaran invaders at bay. Earth enjoys unprecedented prosperity due to the infusion of Trisolaran knowledge. With human science advancing daily and the Trisolarans adopting Earth culture, it seems that the two civilizations will soon be able to co-exist peacefully as equals without the terrible threat of mutually assured annihilation. But the peace has also made humanity complacent. Cheng Xin, an aerospace engineer from the early 21st century, awakens from hibernation in this new age. She brings with her knowledge of a long-forgotten program dating from the beginning of the Trisolar Crisis, and her very presence may upset the delicate balance between two worlds. Will humanity reach for the stars or die in its cradle?",

            "Deep in the heart of Oxford's Bodleian Library, scholar Diana Bishop requests a manuscript called Ashmole 782 in the course of her research. Coming from an old and distinguished lineage of witches, Diana senses that the ancient book might be bound up with magic - but she herself wants nothing to do with sorcery; and after making a few notes on its curious images, she banishes it quickly back to the stacks. But what she doesn't know is that the old alchemical text has been lost for centuries, and its sudden appearance has set a fantastical underworld stirring. Soon, a distracting horde of daemons, witches, and vampires descends upon the Bodleian's reading rooms. One of these creatures is Matthew Clairmont, an enigmatic and eminent geneticist, practitioner of yoga, and wine connoisseur - and also a vampire with a keen interest in Ashmole 782. Equal parts history and magic, romance and suspense, A Discovery of Witches is a novel of epic scope, traveling from the cobbled streets of Oxford to the châteaus and mountains of the Auvergne to a small town in upstate New York. It also takes us into a rich fifteen-hundred-year history that spans Clovis and the Crusades, the Knights Templar, and the American Revolution. As Matthew and Diana's alliance deepens into intimacy, Diana must come to terms with age-old taboos and her own family's conflicted history - and she must learn where the modern woman she is meets the source of ancient power that is her legacy. With a scholar's depth and the touch of a great storyteller, Deborah Harkness has woven a tale of passion and obsession; the collision of magic, alchemy, and science; and the closely guarded secrets of an enchanted world. --",

But her discovery sets a fantastical underworld stirring, and a horde of daemons, witches, and vampires soon descends upon the library. Diana has stumbled upon a coveted treasure lost for centuries-and she is the only creature who can break its spell"

            "This Hugo and Nebula Award winner tells the sweeping tale of a desert planet called Arrakis, the focus of an intricate power struggle in a byzantine interstellar empire. Arrakis is the sole source of Melange, the \"spice of spices.\" Melange is necessary for interstellar travel and grants psychic powers and longevity, so whoever controls it wields great influence. The troubles begin when stewardship of Arrakis is transferred by the Emperor from the Harkonnen Noble House to House Atreides. The Harkonnens don't want to give up their privilege, though, and through sabotage and treachery they cast young Duke Paul Atreides out into the planet's harsh environment to die. There he falls in with the Fremen, a tribe of desert dwellers who become the basis of the army with which he will reclaim what's rightfully his. Paul Atreides, though, is far more than just a usurped duke. He might be the end product of a very long-term genetic experiment designed to breed a super human; he might be a messiah. His struggle is at the center of a nexus of powerful people and events, and the repercussions will be felt throughout the Imperium. Dune is one of the most famous science fiction novels ever written, and deservedly so. The setting is elaborate and ornate, the plot labyrinthine, the adventures exciting"

            "\"A TOR book.\"",
            "Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggins is the result of a desperate breeding experiment, combined with years of harsh and unforgiving training. Ender thinks he is only playing computer simulated war games--in fact, he is commanding the last great fleet to earth. In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut. Young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training. Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives",

Here, he will not be called the name his parents gave him. Here, he will not let fear turn him into a cowering child.

Two years later, Four is poised to take action, but the course is still unclear. The first new initiate who jumps into the net might change all that.

Los Hijos del Emperador estaban obsesionados con la perfección: debido a la falta de guerreros cuando se unieron a Fulgrim, no había manera de que la Legión pudiese compararse con los Lobos Lunares o los Ultramarines en cantidad de victorias, así que se concentraron en la calidad de esas victorias. Durante la campaña de Laeran, se le ordenó al Apotecario Fabius mejorar a los guerreros de la Legión añadiendo nuevos órganos a los Marines Espaciales. Mediante la manipulación de la semilla genética de la Legión, Fulgrim ya estaba cometiendo herejía, pero aún así continuó modificando a su Legión a escondidas. Esta mutación se efectuó sobre muchos Astartes, incluido Eidolon. Al final de la campaña el Primarca tomó un arma de la capital de Laeran, una espada que podia desatar al Demonio que habitaba en ella. Empezó a llevar esta espada más que Filo de Fuego, el arma forjada para él por Ferrus Manus.",

With these three, simple directives, Isaac Asimov changed our perception of robots forever when he formulated the laws governing their behavior. In I, Robot, Asimov chronicles the development of the robot through a series of interlinked stories: from its primitive origins in the present to its ultimate perfection in the not-so-distant future--a future in which humanity itself may be rendered obsolete. Here are stories of robots gone mad, of mind-reading robots, and robots with a sense of humor. Of robot politicians, and robots who secretly run the world--all told with the dramatic blend of science fact and science fiction that has become Asmiov's trademark",

            "\"Red Rising thrilled readers and announced the presence of a talented new author. Golden Son changed the game and took the story of Darrow to the next level. Now comes the exhilarating conclusion to the Red Rising Trilogy: Morning Star. Darrow would have lived in peace, but his enemies brought him war. The Gold overlords demanded his obedience, hanged his wife, and enslaved his people. But Darrow is determined to fight back. Risking everything to transform himself and breach Gold society, Darrow has battled to survive the cutthroat rivalries that breed Society's mightiest warriors, climbed the ranks, and waited patiently to unleash the revolution that will tear the hierarchy apart from within. Finally, the time has come. But devotion to honor and hunger for vengeance run deep on both sides. Darrow and his comrades-in-arms face powerful enemies without scruple or mercy. Among them are some Darrow once considered friends. To win, Darrow will need to inspire those shackled in darkness to break their chains, unmake the world their cruel masters have built, and claim a destiny too long denied--and too glorious to surrender. Advance praise for Morning Star \"Multilayered and seething with characters who exist in a shadow world between history and myth, much as in Frank Herbert's Dune. an ambitious and satisfying conclusion to a monumental saga.\"--Kirkus Reviews Praise for Pierce Brown and the Red Rising Trilogy Red Rising \"[A] spectacular adventure. one heart-pounding ride.

Vowing to fight for the future that his wife believed in, Darrow joins a secret revolutionary group and is remade into a Gold so that he can infiltrate the ruling class and bring them down from the inside. Now, after years of hiding amongst the Golds, Darrow is finally ready to declare open revolution and throw off the chains of oppression.

Each volume presents the contents of one complete issue from the original magazines. Due to its origins as a pulp magazine serial, each story is of magazine-length: what we would usually think of as novella length: rather than being of full novel-length. However, given that this is a continuing serial of virtually infinite length, with hundreds of issues already published in English, and thouands published in German, that does not seem any real drawback!

            "Mare Barrow's world is divided by blood -- those with common, Red blood serve the Silver-blooded elite, who are gifted with superhuman abilities. Mare is a Red, scraping by as a thief in a poor, rural village, until a twist of fate throws her in front of the Silver court. Before the king, princes, and all the nobles, she discovers she has an ability of her own. To cover up this impossibility, the king forces her to play the role of a lost Silver princess and betroths her to one of his own sons. As Mare is drawn further into the Silver world, she risks everything and uses her new position to help the Scarlet Guard -- a growing Red rebellion -- even as her heart tugs her in an impossible direction. One wrong move can lead to her death, but in the dangerous game she plays, the only certainty is betrayal",

              "Mare Barrow's world is divided by blood -- those with common, Red blood serve the Silver-blooded elite, who are gifted with superhuman abilities. Mare is a Red, scraping by as a thief in a poor, rural village, until a twist of fate throws her in front of the Silver court. Before the king, princes, and all the nobles, she discovers she has an ability of her own. To cover up this impossibility, the king forces her to play the role of a lost Silver princess and betroths her to one of his own sons. As Mare is drawn further into the Silver world, she risks everything and uses her new position to help the Scarlet Guard -- a growing Red rebellion -- even as her heart tugs her in an impossible direction. One wrong move can lead to her death, but in the dangerous game she plays, the only certainty is betrayal",

            "\"Naomi Novik, author of the bestselling and critically acclaimed Temeraire novels, introduces a bold new world rooted in folk stories and legends, as elemental as a Grimm fairy tale. \"Every so often you come upon a story that seems like a lost tale of Grimm newly come to light. Uprooted is such a novel. Its narrative spell is confidently wrought and sympathetically cast. I might even call it bewitching.\"--Gregory Maguire, bestselling author of Wicked and Egg & Spoon \"Our Dragon doesn't eat the girls he takes, no matter what stories they tell outside our valley. We hear them sometimes, from travelers passing through. They talk as though we were doing human sacrifice, and he were a real dragon. Of course that's not true: he may be a wizard and immortal, but he's still a man, and our fathers would band together and kill him if he wanted to eat one of us every ten years. He protects us against the Wood, and we're grateful, but not that grateful.\" Agnieszka loves her valley home, her quiet village, the forests and the bright shining river. But the corrupted Wood stands on the border, full of malevolent power, and its shadow lies over her life. Her people rely on the cold, driven wizard known only as the Dragon to keep its powers at bay. But he demands a terrible price for his help: one young woman handed over to serve him for ten years, a fate almost as terrible as falling to the Wood. The next choosing is fast approaching, and Agnieszka is afraid. She knows--everyone knows--that the Dragon will take Kasia: beautiful, graceful, brave Kasia, all the things Agnieszka isn't, and her dearest friend in the world. And there is no way to save her. But Agnieszka fears the wrong things. For when the Dragon comes, it is not Kasia he will choose. Advance praise for Uprooted \"Uprooted has everything I love: a great heroine, new takes on old myths and legends, and surprising twists and turns. A delight.\"--Cassandra Clare, New York Times bestselling author of The Mortal Instruments series \"Wild, thrilling, and deeply, darkly magical. An instant classic.\"--Lev Grossman, #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Magicians Trilogy \"Reading Uprooted was like rediscovering a favorite old sweater, familiar and beloved. It feels as if it has always existed and has been waiting patiently for me to return to it.\"--Maggie Stiefvater, #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Shiver Trilogy \"Uprooted is one of those tales you come back to over and over again because it's just that enchanting. The adventure builds with such tension that you are peeking through your hands at the end, hoping it will all be okay, and Naomi Novik delivers a conclusion that's deeply satisfying, earning a permanent space on my bookshelf that I'll revisit often.\"--Kevin Hearne, New York Times bestselling author of Shattered \"Magical and practical, otherworldly and planted in the real, I could not stop reading this book and neither will you!\"--Tamora Pierce, New York Times bestselling author of Trickster's Choice and Trickster's Queen \"Uprooted by Naomi Novik is enchanting, in every sense of that fine old word. A charming and inviting story that looks unflinchingly at the strangling roots of hurt and revenge.\"--Robin Hobb, bestselling author of Fool's Assassin\"--",

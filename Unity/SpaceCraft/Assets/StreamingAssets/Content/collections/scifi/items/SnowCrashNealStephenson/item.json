  "description": "Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson is a groundbreaking cyberpunk novel that helped define the genre and introduced concepts that would prove remarkably prescient about the development of the internet and virtual reality. Set in a near-future America where the federal government has largely collapsed and been replaced by corporate entities, the story follows Hiro Protagonist, a hacker and pizza delivery driver, as he investigates a new drug called Snow Crash that affects both computers and human minds. The novel popularized the term 'avatar' for virtual representations and explored the concept of the Metaverse, a virtual reality space that predated and influenced real-world developments in VR and online worlds. Stephenson weaves together elements of Sumerian mythology, computer science, linguistics, and anarcho-capitalist politics to create a complex narrative that examines the intersection of technology, language, and consciousness. The book is notable for its blend of high-tech concepts with ancient history and its satirical take on American consumer culture.",

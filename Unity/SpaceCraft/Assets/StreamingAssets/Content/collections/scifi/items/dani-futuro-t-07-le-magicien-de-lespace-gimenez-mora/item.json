  "description": "\"Dani Futuro: Le Magicien de l'Espace\" (The Space Magician) is the seventh volume in the Spanish science fiction comic series created by writer Victor Mora and artist Carlos Giménez. This futuristic adventure series follows the exploits of Dani Futuro, a space-age hero navigating the complexities of interstellar civilization. The comic combines classic space opera elements with distinctly European sensibilities, featuring advanced technology, alien encounters, and cosmic adventures rendered in Giménez's distinctive artistic style. As part of Spanish comics' golden age, this series represents an important contribution to European science fiction comics, offering imaginative storytelling that explores themes of technology, exploration, and human adaptation to life among the stars. The work showcases the international scope of science fiction during the medium's expansion beyond American and British traditions.",

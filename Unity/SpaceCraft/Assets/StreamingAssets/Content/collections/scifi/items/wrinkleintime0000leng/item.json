  "description": "A Wrinkle in Time is a science fantasy novel following thirteen-year-old Meg Murry on a journey through space and time to rescue her missing father. Accompanied by her gifted younger brother Charles Wallace and friend Calvin O'Keefe, Meg travels via \"tesseract\"â€”a method of folding space-time that allows instantaneous travel across the universe. Guided by three mysterious beings (Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which), they visit alien worlds including the conformist planet Camazotz, controlled by an evil disembodied brain called IT. The story explores themes of good versus evil, individuality versus conformity, and the power of love to overcome darkness. L'Engle weaves together science concepts like the fifth dimension with fantasy elements and Christian spirituality, creating a coming-of-age tale that emphasizes self-acceptance and the strength found in differences. The novel won the Newbery Medal and helped establish strong female protagonists in science fiction.",

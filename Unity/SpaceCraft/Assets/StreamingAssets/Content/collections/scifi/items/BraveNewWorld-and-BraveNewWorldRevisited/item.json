  "description": "Brave New World presents a dystopian future society where humans are genetically engineered and socially conditioned into predetermined castes. Set in the World State of 632 After Ford, the novel follows Bernard Marx, an Alpha-Plus psychologist who feels like an outsider, and John the Savage, a man from a reservation who was raised outside the World State's control. Society maintains stability through the drug soma, which eliminates negative emotions, and through conditioning that promotes promiscuity and consumption while discouraging deep relationships and individual thought. The Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre produces humans in bottles, assigning them to castes from Alpha to Epsilon. When John encounters this \"civilized\" world, he is horrified by its lack of art, religion, and genuine human connection, ultimately choosing suffering and authenticity over artificial happiness and conformity.",

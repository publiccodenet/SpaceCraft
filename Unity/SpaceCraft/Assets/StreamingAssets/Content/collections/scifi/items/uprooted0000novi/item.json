  "description": "Uprooted by Naomi Novik is a fantasy novel that incorporates some science fiction elements in its exploration of magic, transformation, and the relationship between humanity and nature. The story follows Agnieszka, a young woman chosen by a powerful wizard known as the Dragon to serve in his tower for ten years, ostensibly to protect her village from the malevolent Wood that threatens their land. While primarily fantasy, the novel explores themes common to science fiction: the nature of power, the consequences of technological or magical advancement, and the relationship between civilization and the natural world. Novik's treatment of magic has systematic, almost scientific qualities, examining how magical abilities might be understood, learned, and applied. The novel won the Nebula Award for Best Novel, demonstrating the increasingly blurred lines between fantasy and science fiction in contemporary speculative literature. The work explores themes of growth, identity, environmental protection, and the power of knowledge and understanding.",

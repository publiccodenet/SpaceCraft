  "description": "Axa is a British comic strip created by Donne Avenell and artist Romero, set in the year 2080 on a post-apocalyptic Earth. The story follows Axa, a young woman who chooses to leave the safety of \"the Dome\" - a protected sanctuary - to live freely in the dangerous outside world. With her striking appearance modeled after Brigitte Bardot, Axa represents a female warrior archetype who adventures through a landscape that blends science fiction elements with heroic fantasy themes. The strip was notable for its adult content and unconventional approach to the post-apocalyptic genre.\n\nThis French collection presents the complete Axa comic strips, offering readers a glimpse into European comic book sensibilities of the early 1980s. The series combines elements of sword-and-sorcery adventure with futuristic settings, creating a unique hybrid genre that was popular in European comics during this period. While the artwork and storytelling reflect the aesthetic preferences of its time, Axa remains an interesting cultural artifact that demonstrates how different regions approached science fiction comics, particularly in their treatment of female protagonists and post-apocalyptic themes. The series stands as an example of how European creators were experimenting with mature content in comics during the late 20th century.",

When you're a teenager it pays to be Invincible. Mark Grayson was just an average kid living in a world full of super heroes. It wasn't until he was a teenager that he gained fantastic powers thanks to his biological father Omni-Man. He was able to fly faster than a jet, lift buildings like Hercules, and battle acne like Proactive. Girls, homework, super villains, it's just another day in the life of the one and only Invincible. Join Mark Grayson in his incredible adventures into the unknown and catch some astonishing surprises while you're at it. This is probably the best superhero comic in the entire universe, or so it claims.</span></font><br />",

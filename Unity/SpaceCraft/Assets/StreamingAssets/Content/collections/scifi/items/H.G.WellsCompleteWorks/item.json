  "title": "H. G. Wells Complete Works",
  "description": "This comprehensive collection showcases the complete works of H.G. Wells, the father of science fiction who profoundly shaped the genre with his visionary scientific romances. Wells pioneered countless concepts that remain central to science fiction today: time travel in The Time Machine, alien invasion in The War of the Worlds, genetic experimentation in The Island of Dr. Moreau, and invisibility in The Invisible Man. His novels combine rigorous scientific speculation with social commentary, exploring themes of evolution, technology's impact on society, and humanity's place in the universe. Wells's influence extends far beyond literature, having predicted many technological developments including atomic energy, space travel, and biological warfare. This collection represents the foundational texts of modern science fiction, establishing conventions and exploring philosophical questions that continue to resonate with contemporary readers and writers.",

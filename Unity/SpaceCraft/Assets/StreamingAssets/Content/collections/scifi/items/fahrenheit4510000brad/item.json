  "title": "Fahrenheit 451",
  "description": "Fahrenheit 451, published in 1953, depicts a dystopian future where books are outlawed and 'firemen' burn any that are found. The title refers to the temperature at which paper ignites and burns. The protagonist, Guy Montag, is a fireman who becomes disillusioned with his role in suppressing knowledge and begins secretly collecting books. Set in an unnamed American city, the novel presents a world where television walls dominate homes, meaningful conversation is extinct, and the population is kept docile through mindless entertainment.\n\nMontag's awakening begins through encounters with his young neighbor Clarisse, who questions the world around her, and accelerates when his wife Mildred attempts suicide, revealing the spiritual emptiness beneath society's enforced happiness. As Montag rebels against the system, he discovers a network of book-memorizing intellectuals who preserve literature orally, waiting for civilization to be ready for books again. The novel culminates in Montag's escape from the city just as nuclear war breaks out, suggesting both destruction and the possibility of renewal.\n\nBradbury's masterpiece operates as both a critique of censorship and a broader warning about the dangers of mass media, conformity, and anti-intellectualism. Written during the McCarthy era and the rise of television, the novel explores how societies can willingly surrender their freedoms for comfort and entertainment. Its themes of knowledge preservation, the power of literature, and the tension between individual thought and social conformity remain powerfully relevant, making it one of the most frequently challenged books in American librariesâ€”an irony that underscores its enduring message.",

  "title": "Whisper of death",
  "description": "Whisper of Death appears to be a science fiction work that combines elements of thriller and horror genres, likely exploring themes related to mortality, advanced technology, or supernatural phenomena explained through scientific frameworks. The title suggests a subtle, perhaps psychological approach to themes of death and danger, rather than overt violence or gore. This type of science fiction often examines how technology might change humanity's relationship with death, whether through life extension, artificial intelligence, or communication with the deceased. The work may explore concepts such as consciousness transfer, near-death experiences, or the intersection between advanced science and mystical experiences. Such stories frequently serve as vehicles for examining philosophical questions about the nature of consciousness, the meaning of death, and what might lie beyond human understanding.",

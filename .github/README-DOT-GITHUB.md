# This is a placeholder for the .github readme.

** Note: this file is named README-DOT-GITHUB.md to avoid the undocumented pitfall that if you name it .github/README.md it will supercede the top level README.md file that github displays on the project page, for some inexplicable reason. So NEVER create a file called .github/README.md and use this one instead.
